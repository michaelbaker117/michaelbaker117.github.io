    <p>Responsive Landing Page:</p>
    <p>This was a project I did in my CSET class in college.
    I needed to re-create a webpage by practicing CSS and responsive design.</p>

    <p>Resume:</p>
    <p>I created a resume in HTML and styled it using CSS. This was my first
    HTML and CSS project. I enjoyed this project because it made me think about
    creativity and design for websites.</p>

    <p>Tic-Tac-Toe:</p>
    <p>This was a group project with my partner Dillon S. and I. We each
    did half of the project. We worked well together and communicated throughout
    the project, letting each  one know what the other was working on and if they
    had made any changes.</p>
