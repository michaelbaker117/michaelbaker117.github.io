Nav: [Home] [Resume]

List of projects and descriptions:
Responsive Landing Page: This was a project I did in my CSET class in college. I needed to re-create a webpage by practicing CSS and responsive design. 

Resume: I created a resume in HTML and styled it using CSS. This was my first HTML and CSS project. I enjoyed this project because it made me think about creativity and design for websites.

Tic-Tac-Toe: This was a group project with my partner Dillon S. and I. We each did half of the project. We worked well together and communicated throughout the project, letting each  one know what the other was working on and if they had made any changes.
