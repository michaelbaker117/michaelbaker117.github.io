        Responsive Landing Page:</a></h2>
      <p>I re-create a webpage by practicing CSS and responsive design in my CSET college class.</p>

      <h2><a href="file:///Users/mfbaker201/code/cset/110/resume/index.html">Resume:</a></h2>
      <p>I created a resume in HTML and styled it using CSS. This was my first
          HTML and CSS project in my CSET college class. I enjoyed this project because it made me think about
          creativity and design for websites.</p>

      <h2><a href="file:///Users/mfbaker201/code/tic-tac-toe/index.html">Tic-Tac-Toe:</a></h2>
      <p>This was a group project with my partner Dillon S. and I. We each
          did half of the project. We worked well together and communicated throughout
          the project, letting each other know what the other was working on.</p>
