        <p>I created a resume in HTML and styled it using CSS. This was my first
          HTML and CSS project in my CSET college class. I enjoyed this project because it made me think about
          creativity and design for websites.</p>

        <h2><a href="file:///Users/mfbaker201/code/tic-tac-toe/index.html">Tic-Tac-Toe:</a></h2>
        <p>This was a group project with my partner and I. We used the Centralized Workflow
          and practiced the Waterfall method to produce a Tic-Tac-Toe game. We each
          did half of the project. We worked well together and communicated throughout
          the project, letting each other know what the other was working on.</p>
